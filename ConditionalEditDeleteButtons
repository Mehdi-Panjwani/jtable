Hi,

I was developing a web app in MVC asp.net and I wanted to show/hide buttons based on a user's priveleges. The buttons access/priveleges for users are defined in a database table.

As per HIK, if we don't assign a value for createAction, it will be hidden. This is ok. However, edit and delete buttons doesn't hide and hence a fix is required.

For below code, all 3 buttons sould hide
    actions: {
        'createAction': '',
        'deleteAction': '',
        'updateAction': ''
    },


In my opinion, the shortest possible fix is to add one condition. Change required in file jquery.jtable.js version jTable 2.4.0:

in line 2535 - if updateaction is blank then no need to create empty header
if (this.options.actions.updateAction != undefined && this.options.actions.updateAction != '')

in line 2545 - if updateaction is blank then no need to create the button
if (self.options.actions.updateAction != undefined && self.options.actions.updateAction != '')


in line 3011 - if deleteaction is blank then no need to create empty header
if (this.options.actions.deleteAction != undefined && this.options.actions.deleteAction != '') {

in line 3022 - if deleteaction is blank then no need to create the buttons
if (self.options.actions.deleteAction != undefined && self.options.actions.deleteAction != '') {


Thanks.
